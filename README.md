# BMI Calculator

This is a cross-platform mobile Flutter application that allows users to input their data (such as height, weight, age, and gender) and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) accordingly. The primary focus of this app is on the user interface (UI) design.

Starting from the defualt flutter app, I customized various aspects of this app, including updating the app theme to create a unique and cohesive look and feel. I also created some custom widgets from scratch, which were tailored to fit the specific needs of the app, also leading to cleaner code.
